      Rasied since birth by the Order of the Silver Hand, Frederick is a righteous zealot that has been commanded to destroy evil wheverever it lurks. 
      Frederick serves the gods - all of them. The pantheon of Good-aligned gods grants Frederick strength to seek out evil beings and summarily execute them.
      Carrying a large hammer and an executioner's axe, Federick will always deal non-lethal damage - until a downed enemy has been determined to be evil aligned.
      He is unrelenting and unwilling to work with any evil forces, and will go to great lengths to kill anyone or anything he deems as evil.
