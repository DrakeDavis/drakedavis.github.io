      Casimir wants to die, badly.
      A former solder, Casimir made a blood-oath with his battalion that they each would die a valiant death in a hard-fought battle. 
      Unfortunately, Casimir was the only survivor. He's spent the years post-war trying desperately to die at the hand of city guards or town drunks. 
      This has taken a large psychological toll, and now Casimir is almost manically suicidal.
