      Terokk is a goddamn bird. What do birds hate? Probably everything - but the Player's Companion says they really hate Elemental Earth beings.
      Why is an Aarakocra on the material plane with a bunch of boring humans? Because he's a super elite bird assassin sent to kill elemental earth stuff. 
    </p>
    <p>DM Notes: In addition to a 50ft fly speed, Aarakocra also get a +2 dex bonus. This hombre starts with a +8 attack bonus with a longbow at level 1.

  <ul>
    <li>Alignment: Neutral Good</li>
    <li>Background: Super Cool Assassin</li>
    <li>Personality Traits: Flies constantly, becomes enraged if he ever has to touch the ground. Really hates earth stuff.</li>
    <li>Ideals: Wants to kill Earth stuff. Also is a bird.</li>
    <li>Bonds: The player's guide is called "Elemental Evil" so I'm assuming there's some Earth elementals he can fuck up. </li>
    <li>Flaws: Probably hates the party. Also racist against non-birds.</li>
  </ul>
