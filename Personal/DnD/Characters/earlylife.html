   <h4>Cenris' Genealogy</h4>
  <p>
    Cendris was born to two Genasi parents, each being half Efreeti. His father was a Human/Efreet Genasi, while his mother was Half-elf/Efreet.
    This muddles Cendris' ancestry - as he is 12.5% Elf, 37.5% Human, and 50% Efreet. Being mostly Genie, Cendris' mortal side can barely handle the elemental magic that his Efreeti lineage grants him.
    By this effect, he is a Wild Magic sorcerer. He has great magical abilities, but trouble controlling it. This leads to unwanted Wild Magic surges when casting spells. Unsurprisingly, Cendris has a
    penchant for fire-based spellcasting.

   <h4>Cenris' Early Life</h4>
  <p>
    Born to his family's tribe, Cendris led a nomadic life with other Firesoul Genasi. Wandering the desert, the eked out a meager existence whilst trying to avoid any settlements. 
    Other mortal races disliked the Firesoul Genasi and many tribes decided it was better to be self-sufficient. Due to the poor disposition of these non-genasi, family was exceedingly important among the Firesoul - to
    such extents that each tribe was usually a large family in itself. Cendris enjoyed the fruits of his tribe, as it grow very powerful due to his father's actions.
