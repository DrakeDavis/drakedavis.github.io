Balthazar is a red-faced OLD man. He's senile and borderline suffering from dementia. 
He is a "Wild Magic" Sorcerer - due to him constantly misremembering and screwing up his spells. 
Balthazar doesn't know how old he is, or where he came from, his main drive for this campaign will be to find any family or friends that recognize him. 

DM Knowledge:
Bathazar isn't just senile, but he's under the effects of a cursed memory. Also - Bathazar is red-faced because he isn't human, he is a human-looking Fire Genasi.
