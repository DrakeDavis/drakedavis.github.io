    Balthazar is a red-faced OLD man. He's senile and borderline suffering from dementia. 
    He is a "Wild Magic" Sorcerer - due to him constantly misremembering and screwing up his spells. 
    Balthazar doesn't know how old he is, or where he came from, his main drive for this campaign will be to find any family or friends that recognize him.

  <p>Alignment- Chaotic Neutral </p>
  <p>Background: Hermit (or Sage?)</p>
  <p>Personality Traits: Senile, and SUPER old</p>
  <p>Ideals: A drive to find someone who knows him</p>
  <p>Bonds: Will have to work with Kyle to see how a Fire Genasi fits into this D&amp;D campaign</p>
  <p>Flaws: Forgetful and easily confused</p>

  DM Knowledge:
  Bathazar isn't just senile, but he's under the effects of a cursed memory. Also - Bathazar is red-faced because he isn't human, he is a human-looking Fire Genasi.





  Pros: You get to hear my old-man voice
  Cons: I have a terrible old-man voice
