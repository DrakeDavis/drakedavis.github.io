  <h1>Cendris' Father: Alranar Flamecaller, the Ashbringer</h1>
</div>
  
 <div class="container">
  <p>
      Cendris' father was a first-generation Genasi, meaning *his* father was Efreet. Being so close to the source of elemental power, he was destined to be an extremely powerful spellcaster.
      In addition to inheriting the power of the Efreeti - he also inherited their evil and aggressive nature. This was compounded by his upbringing, as Firesoul Genasi are feared and disdained by many. 
      Mortal races wanted nothing to do with the Firesoul, with many seeing them as devils or ill omens. Alranar was wrought with anger at this perceived hatred, especially after being abandoned by his Efreeti father. 
      Alraner eventually joined the wandering Genasi tribes and grew within their thin numbers. 
  </p>
  <p>
      As Alranar grew, so did his anger and hatred towards other races. As he aged, he became the leader of his family's tribe. 
      With his overwhelming magic abilities and dark twisted mind, he turned his rage to everything that wasn't Genasi. With a haughty air, he would burn entire villages just to claim their land for his Genasi tribe. 
      Alranar murdered scores. His tribe was feared, but not near as much as he was personally. So many populaces were ill-equipped to deal with multiple fires that Alranar was able to easily dispatch dozens of villages, towns, and cities. 
      His deathcount grew, as did his reputation. Stories of Alranar's flaming wrath spread across townships as peasants began naming him: 'The Ashbringer.'
  </p>
  <p>
      Eventually, the other Genasi realized that they must stop his violet bloodlust. With the aid of the other elemental Genasi tribes, his family's tribe set out to stop his pillaging. With the might of many Genasi working
      in unison, they were able to do so successfully. He was brought back to answer for all he had killed. Even in spite of the Genasi's containment, he showed no remorse - no pity for those he had slain. He still saw them as worthless mortals; they were nothing compared to his elemental ancestry. 
  </p>
  <p>
      The Genasi tribe had no idea what to do with him. They were not prepared to kill off one of their own. His family's tribe refused to execute him. 
      Before he was able to escape and continue his fiery crusade against non-genasi, the tribe decided to enact a powerful curse upon him. This curse, in all the Genasi's compassion, was the Alranar to forget who he was.
      He would have no memory, no prejudices, and no notion of the ten-thousand that he had burned alive. And much to the surprise of many, it worked. It worked so perfectly that Alranar had no idea what had happened, or who he was. 
      Under many a watchful eye, he lived with his Genasi tribe for years without any incident. 
  </p>
  <p>
      That was, however, until there was an incident. Alranar has gone missing. Panic has swept the tribe. Fearful that thousands more would die, the tribe had decided to act. Many Elders have come and gone since that fateful curse, 
      and the new Elders were those that was staunchly against removing Alranar's memory; they believed he should have been put to death for his actions.  
  </p>
  <p>
      Due to his bloodline, the strongest among the remaining Genasi was Alranar's eldest son. As such, Cendris has been dispatched to find his father. The Elders' direction is to kill Alranar for his crimes - whether he remembers them or not.
