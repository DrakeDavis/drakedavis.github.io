    <h3>Cendris' Headflame</h3>
    <p>Cendris was used to living among other Genasi and did not expect the massive detriment his flaming head would be. When his ship first landed in Amphail, every shipyard worker gazed in amazement at his fiery head. The superstitious saw Cendris as a bad omen, while the more educated knew his genealogy contained the Efreet - evil, extraplanar genies. Knowing that his head was the cause of so much disdain, Cendris took action.</p>

    <p>He immediately purchased a hat to cover his headflame, but was dismayed when it ignited and burned to ash on his head. Recognizing his foolishness, he tried to purchase a metal helmet - only to realize his wiry frame could barely support it and that it greatly inhibited his spellcasting ability. </p>
    <p>Sadly, Cendris (at least temporarily) gave up on hiding his flaming head. </p>

    <p>In addition to scaring small children, Cendris' headflame also presents an ever-present fire hazard. During his first night in Amphail, he purchased lodging in 'The Laughing Bandit' inn. He was relived that the innkeeper let him stay and was humored to sleep among the humans. However, poor Cendris' headflame lit the pillow on his bed and caused quite the ruckus as his room became alight. </p>
    <p>After the fire was quelled Cendris was chased out of town by the local militia and escaped into a nearby grove. Sleeping in that forest, his flaming head was a beacon in the darkness - leading to an unfortunate series of attacks by wandering highwaymen. </p>

    <p>While Cendris was dodging arrows by running through the pre-dawn forest, he realized his first order of business was to find something flame-retardant. </p>
