  <div class="container">
    <p>Most fire genasi in the Realms are descendants of the <a href="http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Efreeti">efreet</a> who once ruled Calimshan. When those rulers were overthrown, their planetouched children were scattered. Though far from common, air and fire genasi are more likely to be found in the western regions of Faerûn, along the coast from Calimshan north up to the Sword Coast, and into the Western Heartlands to the east. </p>
    <p>Fire genasi often get themselves into difficulty with their fiery tempers. Like their air genasi cousins, they sometimes flaunt their perceived superiority over common folk.</p>
    <p>As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments.</p>
    <p>The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. </p
