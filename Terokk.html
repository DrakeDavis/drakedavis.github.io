      Terrokk is a goddamn bird. What do birds hate? Probably everything - but the Player's Companion says they really hate everthing about Elemental Earth.
      Why is an Aarakocra on the material plane with a bunch of boring humans? Because he's a super elite bird assassin sent to kill elemental earth stuff.
