      Balthazar is a red-faced OLD man. He's senile and borderline suffering from dementia. 
      He is a "Wild Magic" Sorcerer - due to him constantly misremembering and screwing up his spells. 
      Balthazar doesn't know how old he is, or where he came from, his main drive for this campaign will be to find any family or friends that recognize him.
    </p>
    <p>DM Knowledge: Balthazar is red-faced because he isn't human, he is a human-looking Fire Genasi.
      (Will scratch this if there are other Genasi in the party, I'm pretty sure they would know)
